an example page using PHP, AJAX, CSS and HTML



This is version 0.1 of a simple application to demonstrate how to use various elements in a web application. It shows how to:





use Ajax in a text prompt to avoid needing a submit button on a form
use PHP to access source files (txt) on the server
use CSS to have a responsive design so it can be viewed on a desktop or smartphone

You can see the application at
